Ubuntu Hostname Changer

A simple bash script to change the hostname on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. This script will update the system hostname, modify /etc/hosts, and provide an option to reboot the server for changes to take full effect. Features
Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ubuntu-hostname-changer.git

Usage

Change to the directory using the following command:

cd ubuntu-hostname-changer

Make the script executable:

chmod +x change_hostname.sh

Run the script:

./change_hostname.sh

The script will prompt you to enter a new hostname for the system. After entering the new hostname, the script will update the hostname and the /etc/hosts file accordingly. Youâ€™ll have the option to reboot the system immediately or later to apply the changes fully.
Example

$ ./change_hostname.sh
Enter the new hostname:
my-ubuntu-server
Hostname has been changed to:
   Static hostname: my-ubuntu-server
   Icon name: computer-vm
   Chassis: vm
   Machine ID: <some-id>
   Boot ID: <some-id>
   Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   Kernel: Linux <kernel-version>
   Architecture: x86-64
Would you like to reboot now? (y/n).
