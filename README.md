# Ubuntu Hostname Changer

A simple bash script to change the hostname on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. This script will update the system hostname, modify `/etc/hosts`, and provide an option to reboot the server for changes to take full effect.

## Features

- Change system hostname
- Modify `/etc/hosts`
- Option to reboot for immediate effect

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com//ubuntu-hostname-changer.git

Usage

Change to the directory using the following command:

cd ubuntu-hostname-changer

Make the script executable:

chmod +x change_hostname.sh

Run the script:

./change_hostname.sh

The script will prompt you to enter a new hostname for the system. After entering the new hostname, the script will update the hostname and the /etc/hosts file accordingly. Youâ€™ll have the option to reboot the system immediately or later to apply the changes fully.

Example

$ ./change_hostname.sh
Enter the new hostname: my-ubuntu-server
Hostname has been changed to:
  Static hostname: my-ubuntu-server
  Icon name: computer-vm
  Chassis: vm
  Machine ID:
  Boot ID:
  Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  Kernel: Linux
  Architecture: x86-64

Would you like to reboot now? (y/n)
